Java Program To Find Largest Between Three Numbers Using Ternary Operator
Java offers a lot of Operators and one such operator is the Ternary Operator. It is a linear replacement for an if-else statement. Thus, it is a very useful operator and it uses less space in comparison to an if-else statement.

Ternary Operator Syntax :

variable = condition ? expression1 : expression2 ;
The same statement can be written in if-else statement as follows:

if(condition){
      variable = expression1 ;
}
else{
      variable = expression2 ;
}
Given three numbers we have to find the maximum among them by just using the ternary operator.

class MaximumNumber { 

  

    // Main function 

    public static void main(String args[]) 

    { 

        // Variable Declaration 

        int a = 10, b = 25, c = 15, max; 

  

        // Maximum among a, b, c 

        max = (a > b) ? (a > c ? a : c) : (b > c ? b : c); 

  

        // Print the largest number 

        System.out.println("Maximum number among " + a 

                           + ", " + b + " and " + c + " is "

                           + max); 

    } 
}
